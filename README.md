# 🌞 Level Up Summer Sale - HTML Email
A custom-built HTML email crafted for visual punch and clean performance. Hand-coded by me, Lynsie Samani — no builders, no frameworks, just well-structured HTML + CSS.

This layout was made to show how I approach hierarchy, spacing, and mobile responsiveness in email. Great for campaigns that need clarity and conversion.
